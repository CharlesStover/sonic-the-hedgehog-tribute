# Sonic the Hedgehog Tribute

An artistic tribute to the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, this web application
mimics the introduction screen to the original _Sonic the Hedgehog_ video game
for the _Sega Genesis_ console. A parallax scrolling background gives an
illusion of depth, while sprite sheets are used to animate the logo.

## Controls

Clicking the logo will reset the animation.

Entering
[the Konami code](https://github.com/CharlesStover/konami.js) will change the
background music to a rare 1990's techno song produced by Sega:
_Super Sonic_.
